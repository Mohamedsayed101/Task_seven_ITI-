ملاحظات هامة ارجو  قراءتها كاملة 

I want to clarify a few points about the project.
First, the project A-Z without AI.
Second, the added emojis are done using HTML Entities by searching for them on Google.
Third, I built the readme myself from A to Z, and it's fairly modest and simple.
Fourth, and this is the most important point, the design may not be the best, but that's because it didn't use parts of CSS that we haven't touched on yet. I was literally suffocated and unable to work with what we've come up with so far.
I hope you like it, and the future is exciting, God willing.
